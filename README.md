## 🛠️ Installation: Summon the Script! 🛠️

Fear not, for summoning this power is as simple as chanting these magical incantations (commands):

```bash
git clone [Your Repository URL Here, Once You Create It!]
cd PySpyglass  # Or whatever glorious name you bestow upon the folder
# (No actual installation needed, it's pure Python magic!)
Use code with caution.

🚀 Usage: Unleash the Power! 🚀
Prepare for the revelation! Navigate to the directory you wish to explore (the one containing the script or where you want the output to be saved) and simply invoke the incantation:

python your_script_name.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Witness as PySpyglass springs into action, diligently analyzing the surrounding landscape! A .pyignore file in the target directory? Fear not, it will be heeded! A majestic JSON file, named with the current date and time, will appear, containing the illuminated structure of your folders.

For example, if you run it today, the output might be something like: directory-structure-2023-10-27-14-30-00.txt (or whatever time it happens to be when you unleash the magic!).

🤫 The Power of the .pyignore Whisper 🤫
Want to keep certain files or folders shrouded in mystery? Simply create a .pyignore file in the target directory. List the patterns you wish to exclude, one per line. Think of it as your digital bouncer, deciding who gets past the velvet rope into the JSON party!

Lines starting with # are treated as whispers (comments) and ignored.

folder_to_ignore will magically vanish.

secret_file.txt will remain unseen.

/root_folder_to_ignore will exclude that specific folder at the root level of the scan.

*.log will cloak all log files from view.

🎨 Customization: Bend the Script to Your Will! 🎨
Currently, the output filename is automatically generated. Feel free to tweak the script if you desire a different naming convention. Perhaps you want to add more emojis? The power is yours!
